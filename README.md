# Library-Management-System-c-

## Project Overview:

The Library Management System is a console-based application 
developed in QT using C++ library and functions that allows
users and students to manage library resources effectively. 
The system enables students to access the library data by 
logging in to their accounts. The system supports adding, 
editing, and viewing books.

## Key Features:

User Authentication: The system provides a login option for 
both other users and students, protected by a password.

Facilitator Functions:
 1.Add a book to the system.The student can add
 2.View the status of the books.The facilitator can view the list
   of whether the book is borrowed or not.


## Implementation Details:

The application is implemented inQt using C++. It employs functions, loops, 
if-else, and switch operators to achieve the desired functionality. 
The main() function handles user inputs, presents options to the user, 
and calls appropriate functions based on the selected options. The program 
runs in a loop until the user decides to exit.

This project is suitable for students who have completed a Programming 
Fundamentals course or lab and want to demonstrate their skills in C++ 
programming without using advanced concepts like classes or pointers. 
It provides a solid foundation for further learning and improvement in C++ 
and software development.
